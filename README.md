The Lunar Lander game using machine learning involves training an AI agent to control a spacecraft landing on the Moon's surface. The agent learns to optimize its landing strategy through reinforcement learning, receiving rewards for safe landings and efficient fuel usage. It interacts with a simulated environment, where it observes its state (position, velocity, fuel) and chooses actions (thrusting in various directions). Using algorithms like Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks, the agent improves its performance over numerous trials. The goal is to achieve a successful and fuel-efficient landing on a designated pad.
